Redddit is a website you can log in/make subreddits/create posts/votes other posts/etc and in this code i tryed to rewrite it by myself as well as i could.

## Credits
The most thing i used in my code is "lists" for managing and saving data. 

For keep datas in files to have them if you run the code again i use the **serialization class**; to save datas i used FileOutputStream and to read datas from file i used FileInputStream. 

For each account, comment and post i wrote an ID so that i could distinguish between objects.
